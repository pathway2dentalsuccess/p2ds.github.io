                                    <p>Dental school interviews are usually behavioral interviews conducted by admissions staff to see if a candidate is a suitable fit for the school. Before you go to your dental school interview, consider the following:</p>

                                        <li>When did you decide to become a dentist? (follow up to #2)</li>
                                            <ul style="margin: 7px;">

                                                <li>Focus on important personality characteristics and give examples of how they can be relevant in dental-related settings.</li>
                                                <li>Mention any activities you have participated in that stand out.</li>

                                        <li>What should I tell the admissions about you?</li>
                                            <ul style="margin: 7px;">
                                                <li>This is similar to the previous question.</li>

                                        <li>What are your plans after dental school (usually asked by state schools)?</li>
                                            <ul style="margin: 7px;">
                                                <li>Many schools, especially state schools, want their grads to practice in that state. If it is likely that you will remain in that state after graduation, make sure to mention that.</li>
                                                <li>You may also state any additional future aspirations you have, but be cautious of mentioning that you want to specialize. Some institutions favor students who plan to practice in general dentistry. Additionally, some people may argue that deciding on a specialization prior to entering dental school is not advised.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>KNOW EVERYTHING ON YOUR APPLICATION. You can (and probably will) be asked for more information about any of your activities.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <h3 class="major">What to Wear</h3>
                                    <p>Some colleges conduct interviews over two days, with the first day serving as an information session and the second being the real interview. If this is the case, I recommend wearing business casual on the day of the information session and business formal on the day of the interview. Some people wear business formal clothes on both days, but from what I have seen, most people wear the former.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Post-Interview Etiquette</h3>
                                    
									<p>At the end of the interview, you should thank the interviewer for their time and the opportunity to interview with them. If the school permits students to send thank-you notes after interviews, make sure you get the interviewer's email as well. You can check this information with the admissions office.</p>

									<p>If you wanted to, you could also send a handwritten card to your interviewers. Once again, make sure this is okay with the admissions office and acquire the proper address to send the card to.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>After the interview is over, you will just have to wait for decision day to see if you made it in.</p>
