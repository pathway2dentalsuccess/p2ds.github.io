									<h3 class="major">DAT Content and Overview</h3>
									<p>The DAT is the dental school entrance exam that US and Canadian pre-dental students must take.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">The exam has 4 sections:
                                        <ul style="margin: 5px;">
                                            <li>Survey of the Natural Sciences (100 questions total, 90 minutes)</li>
                                                <ul style="margin: 0px; padding-left: 27px">
                                                    <li>Biology (40 questions)</li>
                                                    <li>General chemistry (30 questions)</li>
                                                    <li>Organic chemistry (30 questions)</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            <li style="margin: 0px;">Perceptual ability (90 questions, 60 minutes)</li>
                                            <li>Reading comprehension (50 questions, 60 minutes)</li>
                                            <li>Quantitative reasoning (40 questions, 45 minutes)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>For a more thorough breakdown of each section, please visit the <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/~/media/ADA/Education%20and%20Careers/Files/dat_examinee_guide.ashx" target="_blank">official ADA DAT Guide</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The official length of the DAT is 5 hours and 15 minutes. However, depending on how quickly you complete each section and whether you choose to take the optional 30-minute break, this may be shorter. Each exam is administered at a Prometric testing center and costs $495.</p>
                                    
                                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                                        <img src="/images/Prometric_Testing_Center.jpg" width="400px"/>
                                        <div class="caption"><a href="https://www.prometric.com/become-test-center" target="_blank">Prometric Testing Center</a></div>
                                    </div><p></p>
                                
                                    <p>One of the positives of the DAT is that you get your score immediately after submitting the exam. However, if someone wishes to retake their exam after receiving their score, they would have to wait at least 90 days before doing so. If someone wants to postpone their exam, there will be an additional fee ranging from $25 to $150.</p>
                                
                                    <h3 class="major">What is a good DAT score?</h3>
									<p>The DAT is scored on a scale from 1-30, with 18 being around the national average score. Applicants with scores higher than 18 typically have better chances of being accepted into dental school; however, some schools will accept lower scores.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Scoring a 20 or higher places the applicant in the top 25% of all test takers. Those who are aiming for Ivy League universities and other top schools will require a score around 23.</p>
                                
                                    <h3 class="major">When is the DAT generally taken?</h3>
                                    <p>The DAT is often completed during a student’s junior year of college. However, you can take it earlier if you finish your prerequisite science courses beforehand!</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">Before taking the DAT, I advise taking the following courses:
                                        <ul style="margin: 5px;">
                                            <li>General Chemistry 1 & 2 with lab</li>
                                            <li>Organic Chemistry 1 & 2 with lab</li>
                                            <li>Biology 1 & 2 with lab</li>
                                            <li>Algebra & Statistics (usually covered in high school math curriculums)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                        
                                    <h3 class="major">What resources are typically used to study for the DAT?</h3>
                                    <p>YouTube is a fantastic free resource for learning any topic covered on the DAT.  However, consider checking out the resources listed below for more comprehensive study tools.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">DAT Destroyer</h3>
                                    <p>For higher-level questions in General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biology, and Quantitative Reasoning, DAT Destroyer is an excellent resource. The DAT Math Destroyer is ideal for more difficult math questions that may appear on the DAT.</p>
                        
                                    <p>Both books were created by Dr. Jim Romano, also known as “Orgoman”, to provide examples of harder questions that may show up on the DAT. Practicing these challenging questions will help fill in knowledge gaps and guide you to achieving the highest possible score.</p>
                        
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Test Prep Companies</h3>
                                    <p>Two DAT prep companies called DAT Booster and DAT Bootcamp are also excellent resources to help study for the DAT. They do require you to pay for a subscription, however. Check out <a href="BoosterBootcamp.html">this post</a> to learn more about them.</p>
                        
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Feralis Notes and Cliffnotes</h3>
                                    <p>Feralis is a student who scored a 28 AA on the DAT. He created some notes to share with the public, and many pre-dental students now use them to study for the DAT. They are available on the <a href="https://datbooster.com/classroom/biology/" target="_blank">DAT Booster website</a>. Once you navigate to the website, select the section you wish to study, and then choose "Study Notes.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>These notes are a very thorough summary of all the concepts you need to know on the DAT. They are especially helpful for the biology section since they are a summary of Cliffnotes: AP Biology, another excellent resource to use to study for the exam. Click <a href="http://chhsstudygroup.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/4/1/13418952/biology_cliff.pdf" target="_blank">this link</a> for a free PDF of the book.</p>
                        
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Anki</h3>
                                    <p>Finally, you might find it useful to use a flashcard app called Anki in conjunction with the above resources to facilitate your content review. Anki is very helpful since it employs a spaced repetition algorithm to improve long-term memory retention. Check out <a href="Anki.html">this post</a> to learn more about Anki and how I use it.</p>
                        
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">How long does it take to study for the DAT?</h3>
                                    <p>Some people have been able to study for the DAT in a month, but most people take 3 months to a year to prepare for the exam. It all depends on how much content you learned in undergrad and how well you recall it.</p>
                        
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">How Do I Sign Up for the DAT?</h3>
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">The DAT is offered year-round at a Prometric testing center. Follow the below steps to apply to take the DAT:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Request for a <a href="https://dts.ada.org/CustomerServices_ADA/NewUser.aspx?transaction=DAT" target="_blank">DENTPIN</a> at least 60-90 days before you plan to take the exam.</li>
                                        <li>Sign into your <a href="https://dts.ada.org/CustomerServices_ADA/AccountSummary.aspx?transaction=DAT" target="_blank">ADA account</a> with the DENTPIN that will arrive via email. Apply to take the DAT.</li>
                                        <li>Schedule a time to take your DAT. Make sure you are certain that you are available to take the exam on this day since the fee is nonrefundable.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>Preparing for the DAT is very difficult, but with the right guidance and practice, you can achieve one of the best scores. To learn more about how I studied for the DAT, visit <a href="HowIStudiedForDAT.html">this link</a>.</p>
