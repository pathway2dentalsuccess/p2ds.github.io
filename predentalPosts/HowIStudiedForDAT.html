                                    <p>Everyone studies slightly differently for the DAT, depending on their backgrounds in each of the subjects. I pursued a non-traditional major (Business Administration), but I also had a minor in Health and Medical Sciences to satisfy the prerequisite subjects required by dental schools. Before taking the DAT, I made every effort to complete my science courses, which included General Biology I & II with lab, General Chemistry I & II with lab, Organic Chemistry I & II with lab, and Microbiology. The math material in the QR section was covered during high school. However, until I began preparing for the DAT, I was unable to learn a few concepts in some of the subjects, particularly biology.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Below is an overview of my score breakdown, how I studied for each section, and a rough study schedule.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">DAT Score Breakdown</h3>
                                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                                        <img src="/images/score-breakdown.png" alt="DAT Score Breakdown"/> 
                                    </div><p></p>
                                    <p>Above is a screenshot of my score breakdown. I will admit that my Perceptual Ability score is a little lower than my other sections because I didn't prepare for it as thoroughly as I should have. Don't make the same mistake I did and put off practicing PAT problems!</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Resources I Used</h3>
                                    <p>Feralis's Notes are an excellent resource for revising any of the academic sections. These notes are a very comprehensive summary of all the concepts you need to know on the DAT. They are particularly useful in the biology portion because they are a summary of Cliffnotes: AP Biology, another excellent resource to use to study for the exam. I did not use this book since I felt that I had a good foundation of biology and only needed to refresh my knowledge using Feralis’s notes and YouTube videos.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>You can find Feralis’s notes on the <a href="https://datbooster.com/classroom/biology/" target="_blank">DAT Booster website</a>. Choose the section you need and then select "Study Notes."</p>
                                    
                                    <p>For a free copy of Cliffnotes: AP Biology, click <a href="http://chhsstudygroup.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/4/1/13418952/biology_cliff.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Anki</h3>
                                    <p>The most helpful tool that helped me achieve my score is a flashcard app called Anki. Look over <a href="Anki.html">this post</a> to see how I use Anki.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I studied nearly 8000 Anki cards to prepare for this exam. The majority of these Anki cards are not mine because I was able to find an excellent deck on DAT Booster based on Feralis's notes. To download these Anki decks, go to the <a href="https://datbooster.com/" target="_blank">DAT Booster website</a>, select a section, and click on "Flashcards." The Anki deck for each subject will be at the bottom of the section.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The only cards I created myself were based on practice questions and exams. Based on the information in each question, I would make one or more cards. For example, in this question below from <a href="https://datquestionoftheday.com/" target="_blank">DAT Question of the Day</a><sup>*</sup>, there are 5 types of bonds that are covered in the answer choices. If I didn’t know the differences between each of these bonds, I would look them up and create a card for each of them.</p>
                                    
                                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                                        <img src="/images/exQ.png" alt="Example Question"/> 
                                    </div><p></p>
                                    
                                    <p><sup>*</sup>Note: I did not use DAT Question of the Day for my preparation, but I think it is a great FREE subscription you can use to start your review each day.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">DAT Booster</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    
									<p>DAT Booster is one of the best tools, next to Anki, for studying for the DAT. After you submit the questions, you will receive explanations that will help you better comprehend the topics. More importantly, the questions are very representative to those on the real DAT. Most DAT Booster questions are harder or of the same difficulty as the real DAT.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Typically, people score within 1-2 points of their most recent DAT Booster practice test. I scored a 23 on my most recent practice test and a 25 on the real exam.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Study Schedule</h3>
                                    <p>I had approximately 4 months to study for my exam since I decided to take it in May right before I applied to dental school. I would recommend leaving more time to retake it if needed. However, if your practice test score is just a few points away from where you want your score to be, you should probably be able to finish studying in 3 months.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">I broke my studying up into 4 phases:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Content review: 1.5 months</li>
                                        <li>Practice questions: 1 months</li>
                                        <li>Practice tests: 1 month</li>
                                        <li>“Last minute” review: 1 week</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    <p>You will see that this doesn’t exactly add up to 4 months. This is because I kept some extra leeway in my schedule since I was still taking classes and participating in extracurriculars while studying for this. Occasionally, I required extra time to finish up projects and assignments or study for exams. Luckily, I was able to choose easier classes that semester, so it wasn't as bad as one would expect.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>All of my studying was done during gaps in my schedule. During larger gaps, I was able to read more material and watch videos for concepts that I didn’t understand or needed a visual representation of. In smaller gaps, I would have my Anki app on my phone and try to finish up as many as I could. Many times I would do Anki while walking to class, waiting in lines, or eating.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>If you are able to finish this exam over the summer I highly recommend it to make it much easier on yourself. The summer following sophomore year is a great time to take it!</p>
                                    
                                    <p>As for the actual schedule I followed, I adapted a rough variation of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/111op1fgk5lSKufPfD_3n_B5o5o7uqLe8/view">Feralis schedule</a> that many people like to follow. I tried to complete PAT questions everyday on DAT Booster based off of the Feralis schedule, but I will be honest, I was not consistent.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Content Review</h3>
                                    <p>I felt that the amount of content review that was included in the Feralis schedule was not always necessary for me. I rarely watched the recommended videos on the schedule. Instead, I would read the Feralis notes for a certain topic and then complete the respective Anki cards for it.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>This was far more beneficial to me than watching videos would have been. I find that active learning methods, such as flashcards, help me retain information better. Other people may be different, but this is what worked best for me.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I did not exactly stick to the subjects that I was supposed to review, according to the schedule, during the content review phase either. Because some units were shorter than others, I would try to fit in another unit on the days I covered that content. Regardless, I would strive to finish 1 unit of each subject everyday (except for a few days I had to take completely off because of other school assignments/exams), allowing me to finish this in roughly 1.5 months. I learned at my own pace and tried to fit in more information if I could.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>At the end of each day, I would make sure to finish whatever was left of my review Anki cards of topics that I already learned the previous days.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Practice Questions</h3>
                                    <p>For the practice questions, I used the DAT Destroyer and DAT Math Destroyer books<sup>*</sup>. I divided the amount of questions in each section by 30 days to get the number of questions I would have to complete each section per day.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>When I did each question, I would make sure I understood all the concepts in each of the answer choices. If I did not, I would create an additional Anki card with information about the concept I was unsure about. Sometimes I ended up with multiple cards of the same topic, but this was beneficial because I could see that topic even more to help it stick in my head.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I would continue doing my review Anki cards at the end of the day or during gaps in my schedule. I was also supposed to continue practicing PAT everyday, but I did not always do so...</p>
                                    
                                    <p><sup>*</sup>Note: I think DAT Booster has extra practice questions now, but they did not have it when I purchased the subscription. Because of this, you may not need DAT Destroyer and DAT Math Destroyer if you choose to use DAT Booster.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Practice Tests</h3>
                                    <p>For this phase of the study plan, I used DAT Booster. There were 10 Booster practice tests, so I took 2 every week. Usually, I tried to take the test around noon, since that was the time I signed up for my real exam. After I completed the practice exam, I would take a break for a few hours and finish up the review Anki cards that were scheduled for the day.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">The next day, I would look over each section of the exam again to evaluate what I got right and wrong, as well as why they were right or wrong. Even if I got a question correct, I would still make sure to look over it. I would review the material the same way I went through the practice questions. I also kept track of why I got each question correct or incorrect using a Google Sheets document. Each question was assigned to one of the categories below:</p>
                                        <ul style="margin: 5px;">
                                            <li>Correct: for questions I was confident about and got correct</li>
                                            <li>Guessed: for questions I got correct but guessed on</li>
                                            <li>Silly Mistake: for questions I missed due to reading something wrong</li>
                                            <li>Content Gap: for questions I missed due to not knowing the material</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>Later, I was able to categorize how many questions I got right because I knew the topic vs. guessing on them, and how many questions I got wrong due to dumb mistakes vs. not knowing the content.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Again, I was supposed to continue doing PAT practice everyday, but I did not always follow through...</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">“Last Minute” Review</h3>
                                    <p>I was fortunate in that I finished my spring semester in school the week before the exam. As a result, I had extra time to go over any last-minute information. I spent more time studying various biological concepts that I was not confident about, and that is probably where I spent the majority of my time this week. I also went over DAT Booster's practice exams a couple more times to make sure I understood everything covered there. The day before the exam, I decided to take a break and made sure I got a good night’s rest.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Exam Day</h3>
                                    <p>I did not do too much right before the exam. After I had breakfast, I warmed up my brain with a few Anki cards of topics I kept missing. Then, I watched some YouTube videos to pass the time, since my exam was at noon. After I ate lunch, I drove to the testing center.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I made sure to use the restroom before the exam and during the break and tried to drink enough water to stay hydrated. I was a little nervous before starting my exam, but I felt much better once it began. There were questions on topics I was familiar with, and I tried my best to make educated guesses on questions I was unsure about. In no time, the exam was over and I got my score!</p>
