                                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                                        <img src="/images/anki.png" width="550px"/>
                                    </div><p></p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">What is Anki?</h3>
									<p>Anki is a powerful flashcard app that helps you retain information in your long term memory by using a spaced repetition algorithm. Due to the massive amount of information that must be memorized in dental school, it is ideal for dental school exams and the DAT.</p>

									<p>One of my favorite ways to study is through Anki, because I can create the cards during or after class and study them anywhere after they've been synced. Anki is free to <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">download</a> on most devices, including desktop and mobile devices. The iOS app, however, costs $25. Still, I believe it is well worth the investment because being able to use Anki on my phone when I am standing in line or walking to class has been immensely useful to me.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How does Anki work?</h3>
									<p>Every time you view the solution to one of your flashcards, Anki gives you three alternatives to click at the bottom of the screen:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;">
											<img src="/images/click-options.png" width="350px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>Whenever I make a guess or don't know the answer, I make sure to click "Again." I select "Good" if I am fairly certain of the answer but my feel that I will forget it if I wait a few days to see it again. Finally, if I am very confident in my response and don't think I need to see the card very often, I select "Easy."</p>

									<h3 class="major">Setting Up Anki</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>First, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">download Anki</a> on your laptop/desktop/phone.</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">When you open it up, it will look something like this (without the DAT Booster deck, blue grid, and stats - I will explain all this later):</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;">
												<img src="/images/opening.png" width="700px"/>
											</div><p></p>
										<li>Create a new deck by going to the bottom of the screen and choosing "Create Deck." It will appear under "Deck" once you've given it a name, just like my "DAT Booster" deck does.</li>
										<li>Click on that deck and then click "Add" at the top of the screen to create a new card. (See below for how to make different types of Anki cards.)</li>
										<li>You're almost done! Make sure you change the maximum amount of cards you can study each day before you begin learning. This only needs to be done once. To do this, click the gear icon slightly under the "New" button.</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">A popup similar to the one below will show up. Change "New cards/day" to 9999 so that all the new cards you create will show up on the day you study. If you want to limit the number of new cards you see everyday, however, feel free to change it to another number.</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/settings.png" width="350px"/>
											</div><p></p>
										<li>If you already have an Anki deck, you can import it by selecting "File" &#8594; "Import" from the top toolbar of your computer. This will allow you to choose the file and load it onto the Anki app.</li>
									</ol>

									<p>You're all done and ready to use Anki now!</p>

									<h3 class="major">How to Make Different Types of Anki Cards</h3>
									<h3 class="card-subheading">Basic Cards</h4>
									<p>Basic cards are similar to traditional flashcards. You can type what you want to show on the Front and Back. Feel free to add images or related concepts on the back of the card.</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/basic.png" width="500px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<h3 class="card-subheading">Cloze Deletions</h4>
									<p>Cloze deletions are one of my favorite features of Anki. They are essentially just "fill in the blank" cards. You can create multiple cloze deletion cards from just 1 paragraph of text. To create a cloze deletion, go to "Add" and switch the "Type" on the top left corner to "Cloze."</p>

									<p>You may end up with something that looks like this:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/cloze.png" width="500px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>It is missing one very helpful feature called "Extra," where you can add supplementary information or images that show up when you "flip" the card. To add this feature, click "Fields..." in the top left corner.</p>

									<p>You will get this popup:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/cloze-fields.png" width="400px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>Click on "Add" and type "Extra". This is case-sensitive, so make sure to capitalize the E. Then, click "Save" at the bottom right corner.</p>

									<p>You will end up with something like this:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/extra-cloze.png" width="500px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>This view may be available by default for some people, but it was not for me, so I wanted to share how to access it.</p>

									<p>To make a cloze deletion, highlight the text that you want to be the fill-in-the-blank answer. Click the image in the top right corner that looks like "[...]". You will end up with the text you highlighted surrounded by "{{c1::}}". Congrats! You have made your first cloze deletion.</p>

									<p>Here is an example of a paragraph with cloze deletions and an extra image::</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/ex-cloze.png" width="550px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>You may notice that each of the cloze deletions have different numbers. This allows each cloze deletion with a different number to appear as a separate card. In other words, the example above will yield 4 different cards. All of the cloze deletions that contain "c2" will be combined into a single card that requires the answer to both of those blanks. See below for an example of the "c2" cloze deletion after it is added to the deck:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/ex-cloze-result.png" width="600px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<h3 class="card-subheading">Image Occlusion</h4>
									<p>Image occlusion cards are cards that let you block out parts of an image. This may be useful for memorizing anatomical parts or diagrams.</p>
									<p>You can set up Image Occlusion by doing the following:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>You must download this add-on using the code given in <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">this website</a>. For more information on how to download Anki add-ons, please scroll down to "Add-Ons."</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Once you have downloaded the add-on, you will see an blue/purple icon in the top right corner when you are in the process of creating a new card:</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/occlusion.png" width="500px"/>
											</div><p></p>
										<li>When you know which image you would like to use, click the blue/purple button. It will prompt you to choose the image.</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">You will then be presented with a screen similar to this but with your image on it instead:</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/occ-before.png" width="500px"/>
											</div><p></p>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">The rectangle on the left sidebar should already be highlighted, allowing you to start concealing whatever you wish to create your flashcards. Start drawing rectangles on the words that you want to hide.	 You will end up with something like this:</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/occ-after.png" width="500px"/>
											</div><p></p>
										<li>Once you are finished, you can click on "Hide All, Guess One" or "Hide One, Guess One" in the bottom right corner.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>You are now done creating your image occlusion cards!</p>

									<h3 class="major">Creating Subdecks</h3>
									<p>If you want to make Anki cards for a class and group each card by Unit, you can do this by doing the following:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Create a new deck for your class. We will call it "Class Notes" for the purposes of this tutorial.</li>
										<li>Create one more deck titled "Unit 1" or whatever name you want</li>
										<li>Drag and drop "Unit 1" onto "Class Notes" and you will have a subdeck!</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">This is what my DAT subdecks look like:</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/subdeck.png" width="400px"/>
											</div><p></p>
									</ol>

									<h3 class="major">Add-Ons</h3>
									<p>Add-Ons are a great way to customize your Anki experience and help you study more effectively. Image Occlusion, as previously mentioned, is an excellent add-on that can be very useful. Heatmap, which is the grid that was on my main screen in the picture under "Setting Up Anki," is another add-on that I like to use. It visually displays how many cards you completed each day, as well as some statistics to keep you motivated to do Anki on a daily basis.</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Anki Add-Ons are available in two formats for download. One method is to copy the code from the Anki Add-On page and paste it into your Anki app, which is how Image Occlusion should be installed:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Find the code in the "Download" section of the add-on of your choice in the Anki website. Image Occlusion can be found <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">here</a>.</li>
										<li>Go to the Anki app and click on "Tools" in the top toolbar on your computer.</li>
										<li>Click "Add-Ons" and then "Get Add-ons".</li>
										<li>Paste the code, restart Anki, and then it is ready to use.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Some add-ons, such as Heatmap, are downloaded directly from the Anki website. Simply go to the respective Anki add-on link and click on the download link for the latest version of the feature. The Heatmap download link can be found <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083">here</a>.</p>
									<p>The full list of Anki add-ons can be found <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1">here</a>.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>There is so much customizability with Anki! It may seem overwhelming at first, and there is a learning curve, but I believe it is well worth the effort to learn. Your studying will become considerably more efficient as a result of this.</p>
