                                    </div><p></p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">What is Anki?</h3>
									<p>Anki is a powerful flashcard app that uses a spaced repetition algorithm to help you memorize information in your long term memory. Is it perfect for dental school exams, as well as the DAT due to the insane amount of information that must be memorized for long periods of time.</p>

									<p>Using Anki is one of my favorite ways to study because I can create the cards during class or after class and study them anywhere after syncing them. Anki is free to <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">download</a> in most places, including desktop and phones. However, it is $25 for the iOS app. I really think it is worth the investment, though, because it has been extremely helpful for me to be able to do Anki on my phone when I am standing in line or walking to class.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How does Anki work?</h3>
									<p>Anki gives you 3 options at the bottom of the screen to click every time you view the answer to one of your flashcards:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;">
											<img src="/images/click-options.png" width="350px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>I make sure to click "Again" whenever I guess on an answer or don't know the answer. I click on "Good" if I feel pretty confident with the answer but might feel like I would forget it if I were to wait a few days before seeing it. Finally, I click on "Easy" if I am extremely confident with the answer and barely need to see the question.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Setting Up Anki</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>First, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">download Anki</a> on your laptop/desktop/phone.</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">When you open it up, it will look something like this (without the DAT Booster deck, blue grid, and stats - I will explain all this later):</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;">
												<img src="/images/opening.png" width="700px"/>
											</div><p></p>
										<li>Create a new deck clicking "Create Deck" at the bottom of the screen. Once you name it, it will show up under "Deck" like how my "DAT Booster" deck shows up.</li>
										<li>Click on that deck and then click "Add" at the top of the screen to create a new card. (See below for how to make different types of Anki cards.)</li>
										<li>You're almost done! Before you start studying, make sure you change the maximum number of cards that you can study everyday. This only needs to be done once. To do this, click the gear icon slightly under "New."</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">A popup similar to the one below will show up. Change "New cards/day" to 9999 so that all the new cards you create will show up on the day you study. If you want to limit the number of new cards you see everyday, however, feel free to change it to another number.</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/settings.png" width="350px"/>
											</div><p></p>
									</ol>

									<p>You're all done and ready to use Anki now!</p>

									<h3 class="major">How to Make Different Types of Anki Cards</h3>
									<h3 class="card-subheading">Basic Cards</h4>
									<p>Basic cards are like typical flashcards. You can type what you want to show on the Front and Back. Feel free to add images or related concepts on the back of the card.</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/basic.png" width="500px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<h3 class="card-subheading">Cloze Deletions</h4>
									<p>Cloze deletions are one of my favorite parts of Anki. They are essentially just "fill in the blank" cards. You can create multiple cloze deletion cards from just 1 paragraph of text. To create a cloze deletion, go to "Add" and switch the "Type" on the top left corner to "Cloze."</p>

									<p>You may end up with something that looks like this:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/cloze.png" width="500px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>It is missing one feature that I think is very helpful called "Extra," where you can add supplementary information or images that show up when you "flip" the card. To add this feature, click "Fields..." in the top left corner.</p>

									<p>You will get this popup:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/cloze-fields.png" width="400px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>Click on "Add" and type "Extra". This is case-sensitive, so make sure to capitalize the E. Then, click "Save" at the bottom right corner.</p>

									<p>You will end up with something like this:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/extra-cloze.png" width="500px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>Some people may have this view by default, but I didn't for some reason, so I wanted to share how to add it in.</p>

									<p>To make a cloze deletion, highlight the text that you want to be the fill-in-the-blank answer. Click the image in the top right corner that looks like "[...]". You will end up with some that has the text you highlight surrounded by "{{c1::}}". Congrats! You have made your first cloze deletion.</p>

									<p>Here is an example of a paragraph that I added cloze deletions and an extra image to:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/ex-cloze.png" width="550px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<p>You may notice that each of the cloze deletions have different numbers. This means that each cloze deletion with a different number will show up as different cards. In other words, the example above will have 4 different cards created from it. The cloze deletions that both have "c2" in them will together be 1 card that requires the answer for both of those blanks. See below for an example of the c2 deletion after it is added to the deck:</p>
										<div style="text-align:center;" >
											<img src="/images/ex-cloze-result.png" width="600px"/>
										</div><p></p>

									<h3 class="card-subheading">Image Occlusion</h4>
									<p>[ADD]</p>

									<h3 class="major">Creating Subdecks</h3>
									<p>If you want to make Anki cards for a class and want to group each card by Unit, you can do this by doing the following:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Create a new deck for your class. We will call it "Class Notes" for the sake of this tutorial.</li>
										<li>Create one more deck titled "Unit 1" or whatever name you want</li>
										<li>Drag and drop "Unit 1" onto "Class Notes" and you will have a subdeck!</li>
										<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">This is what my DAT subdecks look like:</li>
											<div style="text-align:center;" >
												<img src="/images/subdeck.png" width="400px"/>
											</div><p></p>
									</ol>

									<h3 class="major">Add-Ons</h3>
									<p>[ADD]</p>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>There is so much customizability with Anki that you can do! It might be a little overwhelming and a bit of a learning curve at first, but I think it is completely worth the time to learn it. Your studying will become so much more efficient.</p>
