                                    <p>Throughout college, it is important to establish positive relationships with your professors. Fostering this relationship early on will help you get a good recommendation letter for dental school that will greatly benefit your application. It is essential to request these letters in a courteous and timely manner. Continue reading to learn more about obtaining recommendation letters for dental school.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Who should I ask to write my recommendation letters?</h3>
									<p>ADEA AADSAS permits applicants to have up to 4 letters of recommendation. If you have letters from 2 science professors, 1 professor from your major (if you are not a science major), and 1 from a dentist you shadowed/worked with, you will meet most schools' requirements.</p>

									<p>Professors whose classes you took should write most of your letters. However, if you participated in research for a substantial amount of time, you may want to get a letter from the professor you worked under, as well. In some cases, this letter can be counted as a science letter if your research is directly related to science. To be safe, send an email to the schools you intend to apply to to confirm that this is okay.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">When should I ask my letter writers for a recommendation?</h3>
                                    <p>It is important to ask your letter writers a few months before you apply to dental school so that they have enough time to write the letter. Generally, it is a good idea to contact your letter writers in January the year you apply so that there is plenty of time to complete the letter before the application opens in May.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">How do I ask someone to write a recommendation letter for me?</h3>
                                    <p>Once you decide who you are going to ask for letters from, you could approach them in person to ask if they would be willing to write a good recommendation letter for you. When asking a professor, you may want to remind them of the class you took with them, the semester the class was taken in, along with something that will help them remember who you are. If they agree, send them an email with any information you would like them to emphasize, along with a resume so that they know more about your involvements. Some people may request for a draft of your personal statement, so having one ready before then will be really beneficial.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Where do my letter writers submit the recommendations?</h3>
                                    <p>ADEA AADSAS (dental school application portal)  has a section called “Supporting Information” with a subsection called “Evaluations” where you can request letters from your writers directly from the portal after it opens up (usually in May of the cycle you are applying in).</p>
                                    
                                    <p>If your school has a pre-health department, however, is it best to ask them where the letters should be submitted. This process will be handled differently by each school. Some schools will request all the letters to be submitted to a website such as InfoReady so that they can create a pre-health packet with all the letters. You do not have to use this option and can still submit it directly to AADSAS.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Another popular option for many students to use is a website called Interfolio. This service allows you to collect letters before the AADSAS application opens, providing many students a peace of mind that their letters will be submitted on time. This is ideal for students who do not have pre-health departments at their schools or prefer to handle the letters themselves. Because Interfolio keeps the letters confidential from the students, they have the same credibility as if they were sent directly to AADSAS.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Once the letter is submitted, you are one more step closer to having a complete application! For a thorough breakdown of the components of the ADEA AADSAS application, check out <a href= "predentalPosts/AADSASBreakdown.html">this article</a>.</p>
