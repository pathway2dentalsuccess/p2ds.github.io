                                    <p>Dental school is a very rigorous journey that requires students to complete 4 years of undergrad (possibly less if they graduate early or more if they graduate late), 4 years of dental school, and 1-4 years of optional residency if they wish to specialize or gain more experience before working in the real world.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Admissions officers consider a variety of factors when determining who to admit into their schools. The DAT score is the most crucial factor, followed by GPA. Applicants are also required to write a 4,500 character personal statement explaining why they want to be a dentist.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Extracurriculars such as shadowing, volunteering, leadership, and research are also very important, as is work experience. Dental schools will also ask for recommendation letters, which will play a key role in judging how you work with other people in academic or professional settings. Check out <a href="RecLetters.html">this article</a> to learn how and when to request for a recommendation letter.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>A few dental schools have recently required applicants to take the CASPer exam, which has a series of ethical dilemma questions that require a typed or video response. To discover more about CASPer, go to the <a href="https://takealtus.com/casper/" target="_blank">official CASPer website</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Everyone may have different opinions on this, but this is my ranking of the order of importance of each of the requirements:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>DAT score</li>
                                        <li>GPA</li>
                                        <li>Personal statement</li>
                                        <li>Shadowing hours</li>
                                        <li>Other extracurriculars (volunteering, research, leadership, work, etc)</li>
                                        <li>Recommendation letters</li>
                                        <li>CASPer</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    <p>If an applicant’s DAT score and GPA are very high, they might receive an interview, but it is their personal statement, extracurriculars, and reference letters that will set them apart from other applicants. Additionally, a large number of shadowing hours demonstrates commitment to the field. CASPer, however, is a test that assesses someone’s ethics and empathy.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">What DAT score is competitive for dental school?</h3>
									<p>The DAT is scored on a scale from 1-30, with 18 being around the national average score. Applicants with scores greater than 18 typically have better chances of being accepted into dental school; however, there are some schools that will accept lower scores.</p>

									<p>With a score of 20 or higher, the applicant is in the top 25% of all test takers. Those who are aiming for Ivy League universities and other top schools will need around a 23.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">What GPA is needed for dental school?</h3>
                                    <p>The average cumulative GPA for students who matriculated into dental school is around a 3.57, whereas the average science GPA for these students is around a 3.51. This information is based off of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjB6tYBf423PSlfoaxcZ3hcDGp6rxRH4T726GqmzC_Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a> which breaks down statistics from each US dental school in 2021.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Having a GPA higher than this will put the applicant ahead of the competition, but it is not a big deal if it is below average. There are certain institutions that accept GPAs lower than this, and most schools will look at the application holistically. This means that the DAT score, extracurriculars, recommendation letters, and anything else on the application will also be taken into account.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">What extracurriculars are recommended for dental school?</h3>
                                    <p>There are a few types of extracurriculars that many dental schools will look for. Shadowing is the most important since it shows dental schools that the applicant understands the dental field and what it entails. The clinical familiarity will also help while drafting the personal statement.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Other extracurriculars, such as the ones below, are also vital for students to distinguish themselves from other applicants and demonstrate that they are a well-rounded student.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Shadowing</h3>
                                    <p>A good number of shadowing hours to aim for is at least 100. Some dental schools may want to see more than this. For example, the Dental College of Georgia accepts students with an average of 300 shadowing hours. It is not absolutely necessary to have this many hours because most institutions will accept students with fewer hours, but it would not hurt to have more.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Taking advantage of summer/winter breaks to observe local dentists or specialists can help someone quickly reach 100 hours. For example, if they were to shadow for two weeks during the winter break, they would have already completed 80 hours, assuming they go 40 hours each week. Alternatively or in addition, it is possible to shadow during school by going 2 times a week for half a day each or even once a week for the whole day. Most dentists, in my experience, are fairly flexible with the number of hours someone would want to shadow.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Check out <a href="Shadowing.html">this post</a> to learn more about how to get a shadowing opportunity and proper shadowing etiquette.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Leadership Opportunities</h3>
                                    <p>In my opinion, as long as someone has had at least one leadership role that they held for an extended period of time and made significant contributions, that should be sufficient. It is not necessarily vital to have a variety of leadership positions.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Being a member of the executive board of a school's Pre-Dental Club is an example of a good leadership opportunity. Someone might also join the executive board of another organization that they are passionate about. The club does not have to be directly related to dentistry.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Volunteering</h3>
                                    <p>Students can volunteer for anything that they are passionate about. They can serve a variety of groups, including underserved neighborhoods, local communities, and college campuses. Whatever is chosen should turn into a long-term commitment. For example, volunteering at a local food shelter starting from freshman year and continuing to do it as long as possible would be greatly beneficial. People could also volunteer at a few additional locations of their choice.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is important to aim for 100+ volunteering hours or 200+ to be more competitive.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Research</h3>
                                    <p>Not every dental school will look for research on an application. Big research schools, such as the Ivys, however, will certainly want to see some kind of research on an application. It is okay to not have a publication if someone participated in research, but having their name on one would be greatly beneficial.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>When finding a research opportunity, it can be helpful to look through the faculty bios of the college to learn more about their research. If a research topic seems interesting, the student can send an email to their professor describing why they are interested and express their enthusiasm in assisting with the project. Including a resume as well as any classes or past experience that may be relevant to this student research position is important.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Not all professors will have open slots in their labs, it may be necessary to email a number of them. Those who are patient and persistent will ultimately find a project to work on. Some may even be able to complete this research for pay or credit.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Work</h3>
                                    <p>Many dental students have had prior experience working in a dental office. Some have worked at the front desk, some as dental assistants, and others have attended hygiene school and worked as a hygienist for a period of time. While these activities are not required, they can strengthen the student’s application by demonstrating their dedication and experience in the industry.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Other jobs, such as internships or even working in cafes, diners, or stores, can be included on a resume. This suggests that the applicant is capable of providing excellent customer service and has prior experience communicating with others.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">What classes are required for dental school?</h3>
                                    <p>ADEA has a <a href="https://www.adea.org/uploadedFiles/GoDental/Prehealth_Advisors/Getting_into_Dental_School/ADEAAADSASRequiredandRecommendedCourses_FINAL002).pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> of each of the colleges and the courses that they require/recommend. If a course is recommended and the student is not a science major, I do not think it is absolutely necessary to take it. It will absolutely help when dental school begins and those classes must be taken again, but if there are other ways to demonstrate commitment to science and dentistry, the application should be fine.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">Common courses that dental schools will recommend/require are the following:
                                        <ul style="margin: 5px;">
                                            <li>Anatomy</li>
                                            <li>Cell biology</li>
                                            <li>Histology</li>
                                            <li>Immunology</li>
                                            <li>Microbiology</li>
                                            <li>Molecular biology</li>
                                            <li>Genetics</li>
                                            <li>Physiology</li>
                                            <li>Zoology</li>
                                            <li>Calculus</li>
                                            <li>Statistics/biostatistics</li>

                                            <li>Psychology</li>
                                            <li>Sociology</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                
                                    <h3 class="major">What is the best major for getting into dental school?</h3>
                                    <p>It makes no difference which major someone chooses for dental school, as long as the required courses are complete. If majoring in science seems more beneficial, that can be chosen. Otherwise, any other major will suffice.</p>
