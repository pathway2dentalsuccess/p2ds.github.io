                                    <p>DAT Booster and DAT Bootcamp are 2 of the most popular test prep companies for the Dental Admissions Test (DAT). Many students wonder if they should use both resources or just one of them. In this article, I will break down the differences between the 2 resources and explain who should use DAT Booster, DAT Bootcamp, or both.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Although I have not used both resources, I have done extensive research about the distinctions of these two subscriptions and incorporated opinions of many people who actually have used both resources. I have only used DAT Booster, so I will also cover my experience with it in this article. </p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">DAT Bootcamp Overview</h3>
									<p><a href="https://datbootcamp.com/classroom/" target="_blank">DAT Bootcamp</a> was created by Dr. Ari Rezaei, a former student who scored a 25 AA on the DAT. He is very well-known for developing an effective study schedule that many pre-dental students use to study for the DAT.</p>

									<p>DAT Bootcamp was founded before DAT Booster and has assisted over 30,000 students in doing well on the DAT. According to the website, the subscription includes the following material as of January 2022:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>60+ practice tests for each category (i.e. Genetics, Taxonomy, Algebra)</li>
                                            <li>330+ organic and general chemistry concept videos from Dr. Mike</li>
                                            <li>55+ PAT videos</li>
                                            <li>19+ reading comprehension videos</li>
                                            <li>Unlimited PAT generators</li>
                                            <li>10 full length exam simulations</li>
                                            <li>4670+ total questions</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <!--</p>-->
                                
                                    <p>The Bootcamp Pro subscription costs $497 (90 days of access and all of the above material) and $1197 for Bootcamp Plus (180 days of access and 1150 extra questions along with Bootcamp Pro material). An iOS and Android app are also available for on-the-go studying.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">DAT Bootcamp Overview</h3>
                                    <p><a href="https://datbooster.com/" target="_blank">DAT Booster</a> was introduced by the creators of PAT Booster, the most popular perceptual ability practice tool for the DAT. They partnered with Feralis, a former pre-dental student who scored a 28 on the DAT with his extensive notes, to create publicly available DAT notes by topic.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Despite the fact that DAT Booster is a newer company than DAT Bootcamp, they have done an excellent job of publishing up-to-date content to the website. The website claims that the subscription offers the following, as of January 2022:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>62+ practice tests for each category</li>
                                            <li>200+ organic and general chemistry concept videos</li>
                                            <li>65+ PAT videos</li>
                                            <li>22+ reading comprehension videos</li>
                                            <li>Unlimited PAT generators</li>
                                            <li>10 full length exam simulations</li>
                                            <li>6200+ total questions</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <!--</p>-->
                                    
                                    <p>At $299 for a 90-day membership, the subscription is less expensive than DAT Bootcamp. You will have to pay the $299 cost again if you need an additional 90 days. At the moment, there is no iOS or Android app linked with this service.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Should I use DAT Bootcamp or DAT Booster?</h3>
                                    <p>Many people have stated that the videos in DAT Bootcamp are some of the best resources, especially the chemistry videos by Dr. Mike that come with the subscription. They are simple to comprehend, and Dr. Mike provides mnemonics to help retain the information. DAT Booster, on the other hand, is not as strong in this video category, but it has FREE straightforward and comprehensive notes.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>One user of both subscriptions also stated that both resources have a marking feature for questions. Bootcamp allows the user mark questions as “Learning,” “Reviewing,” or “Mastered.” Booster, however, only lets the user to mark a question and review it later; there are no categories available.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>As for the practice questions, the majority of people who have used both resources agree that Booster includes questions that are more representative of the actual exam. Although these both resources have questions that are more difficult than the actual exam, many individuals, including myself, have noticed questions on their actual exam that are very similar to the Booster questions.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The general consensus is that DAT Bootcamp has better videos than DAT Booster. However, many individuals, including myself, still believe that DAT Booster's videos are sufficient for learning the content. Keep in mind that YouTube is another free resource that can be used for further explanation of a concept. DAT Booster also offers a free, updated version of Feralis’s notes on their website under each of the categories in the “Study Notes'' section. Reading these notes and watching the corresponding videos (if needed) on the subscription of your choice or YouTube may be more beneficial for certain people. This is what I did, and you can read more in detail about how I studied in <a href="HowIStudiedForDAT.html">this post.</a></p>
                                    
                                    <p>I was very satisfied with the resources that my DAT Booster membership provided, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is going to take the DAT soon. If the videos are not sufficient for you, I think there are plenty of YouTube videos that will help with understanding and memorizing concepts. If you feel like you need more help on content review and want the convenience of all the videos in one place, however, you may want to consider purchasing DAT Bootcamp. In that circumstance, buying both subscriptions would be ideal.</p>
