                                    <p>Some high school students may have an early interest in dentistry and wish to learn more about it. These students can improve their foundation in the sciences and shadow dentists, if allowed.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Classes To Take</h3>
                                    <p>Honors, AP, IB, and dual enrollment courses can help high school students create a strong foundation in the sciences before enrolling in college. If the undergraduate institution they attend offers credits for AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes, they may be able to skip the respective courses.</p>

                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">There are certain essential honors, AP, IB, and dual enrollment classes that can be taken if they are available at the school:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Biology</li>
                                        <li>Chemistry</li>
                                        <li>Physics</li>
                                        <li>Psychology</li>
                                        <li>Environmental Science</li>
                                        <li>Anatomy</li>
                                        <li>Physiology</li>
                                        <li>Organic Chemistry</li>
                                        <li>Calculus</li>
                                        <li>Statistics</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>The courses listed above contain content that may appear on the Dental Admissions Test (DAT) or correspond to undergraduate classes required by dental schools. If credit is earned for them in high school through AP, IB, or Dual Enrollment, they may be transferred to college and used to meet dental school requirements. If these courses are used for both high school and college credit, however, it is recommended to take upper level classes in the respective subject. Someone with AP Biology credit, for example, would not have to take Biology 1 in college. They would still be required to take Biology 2, but it would be preferable if they also took another upper-level biology course, such as microbiology. This demonstrates that the student is capable of taking college-level courses.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Extracurriculars</h3>
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Volunteering</h4>
                                    <p>Volunteering is an excellent method for students to not only strengthen their college applications, but also to get more involved in giving back to their communities. Volunteering is crucial in dental school, and all institutions will check for demonstrations of service on an applicant's resume. Usually, only volunteering activities completed in college are allowed to be added to the application. However, if someone has been involved in an organization or activity since they were in high school and continues it in college, they can mention that in the activity description. This dedication will stand out on someone's application.</p>

                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Shadowing</h4>
                                    <p>Shadowing is a great way to learn more about a profession by getting first-hand experience in what someone in the profession does. Some high schools have internship programs to help the student find a shadowing opportunity, but others may have to find one on their own. Finding a shadowing opportunity as a high school student may be more challenging than finding one as an undergraduate student. Read<a href="https://pathwaytodentalsuccess.me/predentalPosts/Shadowing.html">this article</a> for tips on finding a shadowing opportunity and to learn about shadowing etiquette.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>Many high school students are undecided about what they want to do as a career. After the first few semesters of college, it is fairly common for students to change majors. Exploring potential options in high school via shadowing and internships is a great way to help students decide what type of career they may want to pursue.</p>

                                    <p>Taking a diverse range of classes in high school is also beneficial in the event that a student decides to change majors in college later. Biology, chemistry, physics, and calculus are required for graduation for most students, but the other subjects are typically optional. It is a good idea for students to take these extra courses if they have time in their schedules, but it is more important to take harder versions (AP, IB, and sometimes dual enrollment) of required courses.</p>
