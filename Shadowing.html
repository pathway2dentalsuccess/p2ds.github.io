                                    <p>Shadowing is a great way for pre-dental students to learn more about dentistry and all the specialties of dentistry. They follow around the dentists to observe their day-to-day activities in the office and learn how to run a good practice. </p>
									<h3 class="major">Finding a Shadowing Opportunity</h3>
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">In-Person Shadowing </h3>
									<p>Some practices may only allow you to stay for 1-2 days, while others may let you stay for weeks or months. It all depends on the dentist and/or management and what they are comfortable with.</p>

									<p>Reach out to your general dentist first to ask if you could shadow them. Since you already know them and have built a relationship with them, they are more inclined to agree. It is perfectly fine if they say no. Thank them for taking the time to consider it, and then contact other local offices that you can find through a simple Google search. Try to acquire most of your hours at a general dentist, but explore other specialties, as well, if you are interested.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>When you call the front desk, introduce yourself as a pre-dental student, tell them where you are attending and your year, and let them know that you are looking for a shadowing opportunity for however many hours you prefer. Make sure you also mention which days you'd like to go in. You may need to reach out to a few offices because not everyone will be comfortable with people shadowing them.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Due to the pandemic, many people, including me, found it very difficult to find shadowing hours. I had to call nearly 40 offices to find somewhere to shadow. Although it will take a lot of time and effort, it will pay off in the end, and you will eventually find someone who will say yes.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="card-subheading">Virtual Shadowing </h3>
                                    <p>Because of COVID-19, some schools are taking virtual shadowing hours in lieu of in-person shadowing hours. Virtual shadowing is an excellent way to learn more about dentistry, but it does not provide the same interactions and experiences as in-person shadowing.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Check to see which schools accept virtual shadowing hours before looking for virtual shadowing opportunities. This is not permitted in all schools.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Virtual shadowing might be a little easier to come by than in-person shadowing. There are many small organizations that are sponsoring this on YouTube Live or some universities that are providing these opportunities. For example, @dentalshadowers on Instagram hosts virtual shadowing via YouTube.</p>
                                    
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Shadowing Etiquette</h3>
                                    <p>Once you find an office that will let you shadow, you can inquire about the officeâ€™s dress code. Most offices will ask you to wear scrubs, but some may suggest business casual.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">Make sure you ask a lot of questions while shadowing, but also be respectful of the dentist's time. You can ask them when they are not with a patient. You can also prepare questions in advance. Here are some example questions to ask:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Why did you want to become a dentist?</li>
                                        <li>What is your favorite part of being a dentist?</li>
                                        <li>What is your least favorite part of being a dentist?</li>
                                        <li>What do you think makes a successful practice?</li>
                                        <li>What do you wish you knew before you started practicing?</li>
                                        <li>Do you have any advice on how to be a successful student?</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    <p>You can also ask for details about procedures, such as the purpose of the materials they are using. Some dentists will also show you how to read x-rays if you ask them.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>At the end of your shadowing, write the dentist a thank you card for letting you observe in the office. Make sure to express gratitude for what you have learned and thank them for their time.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>A lot of the dental assistants will also teach you many concepts if you ask them questions. You could write them cards, as well, if you would like. As an appreciation for their time, you may also bring in treats for everyone in the workplace, such as coffee and donuts.</p>
