									<h3 class="major">What dental schools did I apply to?</h3>
									<p>I applied to a variety of public and private schools, resulting in a total of 15 schools. This is slightly higher than the national average of applying to 10 schools, but I wanted to apply to as many as possible since I intended this application to be my only submission. I did not want to have any regrets of not applying to some of the schools.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">As for the exact schools I applied to, here is the full list:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)</li>

                                    </ol>

									<p>For reference, I am a Georgia resident, so the only in-state dental school available for me was the Dental School of Georgia.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>These colleges appealed to me because they all provide excellent programs and fit my stats. To put it another way, my statistics were comparable to or better than the national average for these colleges.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>More information on how to choose which dental schools to apply to can be found in <a href="HowToChooseDentalSchool.html">this post.</a></p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">What dental schools did I get into?</h3>
                                    <p>Of these 15 schools, I interviewed and received offers from Case Western, Columbia, DCG, NYU, and UF. I was rejected from UCLA, UCSF, UW, and OSU.</p>

                                    <p style="margin: 0px;">In undergrad, I strived to be a very involved student. Below is a list of every extracurricular activity I participated in, along with a brief summary of what I did:

                                    </p>
                                    <p>I also included my hobbies of piano and origami on my application since they were related to manual dexterity.</p>

                                    <p>As for my stats, my GPA is a 3.80 and my DAT score is 25AA. For a more detailed breakdown of my score and how I studied, see <a href="HowIStudiedForDAT.html">this page.</a></p>

                                    <p>It was quite challenging for me to do all of this in 3 years (since I applied after my 3rd year of college). Because I had so many commitments to fit into one day, I had to stay up late studying many evenings. COVID-19 also hit during my sophomore year, so it was extremely difficult to get some of the requirements done, especially shadowing. I am very fortunate to find dentists who were willing to take me in after some of the cases started to settle down my junior year.</p>

                                    <p>My suggestion to anyone interested in going to dental school is to begin as early as freshman year. If a student were to volunteer and shadow for a couple of hours each week, they will have accumulated enough hours by the end of their third year. Even if they are not sure if dentistry is for them, shadowing will greatly help them in determining whether it is. Some people prefer to begin their second semester of freshman year so that they can use the first semester to adjust to the new college environment.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">What was my dental school interview experience?</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>The majority of the schools I applied to asked me questions about topics that were already on my application. They asked me why I wanted to be a dentist and also requested me to elaborate about my extracurriculars. They also wanted to know why I desired to attend that particular dental school. Check out <a href="Interview.html">this post</a> to learn more about interview preparation for dental school.</p>

                                    <p>Overall, I thought all of my interviews went well. The interviewers were all very nice and welcoming, and it was fairly easy for me to connect with them.</p>
